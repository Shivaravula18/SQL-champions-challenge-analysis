Day 1 - Assignment

Question 1:
Create a new project - “project-c” in BigQuery.

Question 2:
Create 2 different datasets in project-c. Dataset names should be learning_sql and practice_sql.

Question 3:
In learning_sql dataset, create a table named learning_table_1 with the following fields:
- student_id INTEGER,
- student_name STRING,
- course_enrolled STRING,
- enrollment_date DATE,
- course_progress FLOAT,
- is_active BOOLEAN

Day 2 - Assignment

Create a Table with Constraints:
Create a table named students_info with the following structure and constraints:
- student_id should be the primary key.
- student_name should not be NULL.
- course_enrolled should not allow NULL values.
- course_progress (float, no constraints)
- is_active (boolean, no constraints)

Add a New Column:
Add a new column email of type STRING to the students_info table.

Modify a Column:
Modify the course_progress column to restrict its values to only two decimal places.

Add a UNIQUE Constraint:
Add a UNIQUE constraint on the email column to ensure that no two students can have the same email address.

Add a CHECK Constraint:
Add a CHECK constraint to ensure that the course_progress is always between 0 and 100.

Drop a Column:
Drop the email column from the students_info table.

Rename a Column:
Rename the student_name column to full_name.

Add a Default Value:
Add a default value of TRUE for the is_active column to indicate that students are active by default.

Drop a Constraint:
Drop the check_course_progress constraint from the students_info table.

Truncate the Table:
Remove all data from the students_info table without deleting the table.

Day 3 - Assignment

Dataset: Champions Challenge Dataset
(Four tables: users_basic_details, day_wise_user_learning_activity, lesson_details, challenge_rewards)

Question 1:
For each user and lesson, calculate their cumulative lesson completion percentage over time.

Question 2:
For each lesson, calculate the average overall_completion_percentage and rank the lessons based on this average.
Expected Output: | lesson_id | average_completion_percentage | rank_of_lesson |

Question 3:
For each user and lesson, identify the lesson start date and lesson end date/latest progress date.
Expected Output: | user_id | lesson_id | lesson_start_date | lesson_end_or_last_progress_date |

Question 4:
Pivot the overall_completion_percentage by lesson_id for each user. Show a row for each user_id and columns for each lesson_id (only lessons 1–5).
Expected Output: | user_id | lesson_1_completion_percentage | lesson_2_completion_percentage | ... |

Question 5:
Rank lesson_id-wise completed users based on their completion datetime.
Expected Output: | lesson_id | user_id | rank |

Question 6:
Determine the sequence in which each user completed their lessons.
Expected Output: | user_id | lesson_id | order_of_completion |

Question 7:
For each lesson_id and user id, get the user who completed before him and the user who completed after him.
Expected Output: | lesson_id | user_id | rank_of_user | previous_user_who_completed | next_user_who_completed |

Question 8:
For each lesson, get the user who is the 4th person to complete the lesson.
Expected Output: | lesson_id | fourth_person_who_completed |

Day 6 - Assignment

Question 1:
Write a query to list all the tables in the dataset my_project.my_dataset.

Question 2:
Write a query to get the column names, data types, and whether they are nullable, for the table my_table in my_dataset.

Question 3:
Write a query to list the tables that have been queried the most, based on the number of query jobs run in the dataset my_project.my_dataset.

Question 4:
Write a query to find all tables in your dataset my_dataset that have zero rows.

Question 5:
Write a query to list all views in the dataset my_dataset along with the creation time and view definition.

Question 6:
Write a query to list all the schemas in the project my_project.
